# Launch notes

This is the launch path for `polars-janitor` once the release workflow has produced wheels and PyPI has `0.1.0`.

## Polars community first

Post in the Polars community before Hacker News. The ask should be API and design feedback, not attention.

Draft:

> I built `polars-janitor`, a small Rust-backed package with cleanup helpers for Polars dataframes.
>
> It is inspired by R's janitor, but it is not trying to port janitor function by function. The first release focuses on name cleanup, spreadsheet header cleanup, dataframe hygiene, duplicate records, and quick schema inspection.
>
> The design goal is to avoid wrappers around Polars APIs that are already clear. I would especially like feedback on the public API shape, LazyFrame limits, and whether the feature bar feels Polars-native enough.
>
> Repo: https://github.com/VovaVili/polars_janitor
> Install: `pip install polars-janitor`

## Hacker News after feedback

Post to Hacker News after the first round of Polars feedback has been handled.

Suggested title:

```text
Show HN: polars-janitor, small cleanup helpers for Polars DataFrames
```

Opening comment:

> I built this after looking at R's janitor and asking which parts actually make sense in Polars.
>
> The package is intentionally small. It cleans column names, promotes messy spreadsheet rows to headers, removes empty rows/columns, removes constant columns, returns duplicate records by key, and compares frame schemas. It does not register a dataframe namespace, and it does not include `tabyl`, `adorn_*`, or wrappers around native Polars APIs like `pivot`, `value_counts`, or string concatenation.
>
> The implementation is Rust with a thin Python import surface. Eager frames go through `pyo3-polars`; LazyFrames build public Python Polars plans from Rust so the package does not depend on Polars' internal lazy-plan serialization.
>
> I would like feedback from Polars users on what belongs in a cleanup helper package without turning it into a grab bag.

## Ground rules

- Do not ask for votes.
- Make the install path obvious.
- Be present in comments on launch day.
- Be direct about limits. This is `0.1.0`, not a full R janitor port.
- Keep feature requests to the existing bar: real Polars cleanup friction, janitorial theme, testable behavior.
